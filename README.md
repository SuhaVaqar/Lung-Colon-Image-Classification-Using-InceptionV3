# Lung Colon Image Classification Using InceptionV3

A deep learning project that uses transfer learning with **InceptionV3** to classify lung and colon cancer histopathological images into three categories. This project is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

## Overview

This project focuses on using a pre-trained **InceptionV3** model for image classification to identify lung and colon cancer types from medical histopathological images. The model is fine-tuned for this specific task and achieves high accuracy through transfer learning.

## Dataset

The **Lung Colon Image Dataset** consists of three categories:
- **Lung Adenocarcinoma**
- **Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma**
- **Colon Adenocarcinoma**
